# 🖋 Handwriting Teacher: Rediscovering the Art of Handwriting 📜

## 🌟 *Inspiration*

In the digital age, the gentle strokes and arcs of handwritten letters have faded away. The tactile pleasure of a pen gliding on paper and the distinct personality of every hand is on the brink of becoming a lost art. Many, especially those learning a new script or those whose schooling didn't emphasize handwriting, find themselves struggling with clear, legible script.

Enter the '*Handwriting Teacher*' - born out of a personal struggle with the Cyrillic alphabet and a desire to provide a smart solution.

## 🚀 *What It Does*

The Handwriting Teacher employs cutting-edge technology to guide you on your journey towards handwriting mastery:

1. *📘 Dynamic Learning*: Generates phrases, sentences, or character strings targeting specific letters or areas you're struggling with.
2. *🔍 Feedback Loop*: Users can input their handwritten attempts either by uploading a photo or drawing directly on the platform. OCR technology then parses and scores the handwriting, offering constructive feedback.
3. *📈 Progress Tracking*: It's not just about practice; it's about progress. Track your improvement over time and set new challenges.
