# 🖋 Likhit 🖋
# Crafting Elegance, Where Penmanship meets Perfection

## *Inspiration*

In the age of instant messaging and fleeting digital interactions, the raw authenticity and intimacy of handwritten notes have become rare treasures. Every curve, every stroke, every flourish of a handwritten letter holds a story, an emotion, a piece of someone's essence. It wasn't just about writing; it was about expressing oneself in the purest form. Recognizing this lost connection, and driven by personal struggles with mastering scripts, the idea of 'Likhit' was born. We aspired to create a bridge between the digital age and the age-old art of penmanship, enabling individuals to rediscover the joy and elegance of writing by hand. Through Likhit, we aim to reignite that personal touch in communication, ensuring that the beauty of handwriting thrives in our digital world.

Enter the *Likhit* - born out of a personal struggle with handwriting and love for the art of writing.



## *What It Does*

Likhit employs cutting-edge technology to guide you on your journey towards handwriting mastery:

1. *📘 Dynamic Learning*: Generates phrases, sentences, or character strings targeting specific letters or areas you're struggling with.
2. *🔍 Feedback Loop*: Users can input their handwritten attempts either by uploading a photo or drawing directly on the platform. OCR technology then parses and scores the handwriting, offering constructive feedback.
3. *📈 Progress Tracking*: It's not just about practice; it's about progress. Track your improvement over time and set new challenges.

## 💡 *How We Built It*

With a balanced mix of creativity and technical prowess, the team utilized:

- *🖥 Front-end*: A sleek interface designed with Flexbox layouts, powered by p5.js for canvas writing and Javascript for dynamic interactions.

- *🧠 Smart Algorithms*: Python-driven sequence alignment algorithms match, score, and analyze user handwriting against ideal standards.

## 🏆 *Challenges & Triumphs*

Building Likhit was not without its own challenges. From conceptual dilemmas to the nuances of text recognition, the journey was intense to say the least. The path to the final product was filled with numerous blocks and dead ends.

However, the results speak for themselves:

- *High Accuracy*: Our text recognition and matching capabilities are second to none.
- *💬 Innovative Use of GPT-4*: We harnessed the capabilities of Chat GPT-4 for targeted learning phrase generation.
- *🤝 Team Synergy*: Despite being our first collaborative project and many of us being first time hackers, the team's unity and shared vision were our biggest assets.
